The compressed forlder include files units which help the programmers make easier their job when use pascal language for AVR MCU.  For the MCU which i had in my boxes i made some libraries. Those are the uncompressed files. The zip folder contains all microcontroller libraries which are made with a program which i found in Github (https://github.com/ccrause   https://github.com/ccrause/importATDF)
The software is free to use and must be consider as untested.
